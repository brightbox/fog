# OBSOLETE fork of the Ruby cloud computing library

This has been a mirror of the official [fog](http://github.com/fog/fog) repo
for some time and we are no longer planning to keep it up to date.

It ends at the functional equivalent of `fog-v1.22.0`

Brightbox updates now occur in our plugin/module
[fog-brigthtbox](http://github.com/brightbox/fog-brightbox) and are included
in later versions of `fog` automatically.
